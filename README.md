# Diamond Price Stacked Regressor

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that implements a stacked regressor model to predict diamond prices. The notebook utilizes the dataset available on Kaggle, which includes various attributes of diamonds along with their corresponding prices.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis can be accessed on Kaggle using the following link: [Diamonds Prices Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nancyalaswad90/diamonds-prices). The dataset contains information about the carat weight, cut, color, clarity, and other attributes of diamonds, along with their corresponding prices.

## Notebook

The notebook file in this repository, named `Diamond_Price_Stacked_Regressor.ipynb`, contains the code and documentation for training and evaluating the stacked regressor model to predict diamond prices. The notebook covers data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

## Contents

The notebook consists of the following sections:

1. Data Loading and Preprocessing: This section focuses on loading the dataset, examining its structure, handling missing values, and performing any necessary data preprocessing steps, such as encoding categorical variables and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

2. Model Building: In this section, a stacked regressor model is constructed to predict diamond prices. The stacked regressor combines multiple regression models, such as linear regression, decision tree regression, or random forest regression, to improve the prediction performance.

3. Model Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated using appropriate metrics, such as mean squared error, mean absolute error, or R-squared, to assess its performance in predicting diamond prices.

4. Conclusion: The concluding remarks provide a summary of the analysis, highlighting the key findings and insights gained from the model's performance.

## Usage

To run the notebook locally, you need to have Jupyter Notebook installed on your machine. Clone this repository and open the `Diamond_Price_Stacked_Regressor.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook to execute the code cells and interact with the analysis.
